# EyeGenValues
Simple 1D eye-evolution via genetic algorithms with a QT graphical display

Simulates a light-sensitive cell under N layers of cells, and uses a genetic
algorithm to find the best child of a generation, then choose that child as
the parent for the next generation.

Originally designed in 1987 for the Atari ST and now ported to QT GPL. The
initial focal length can be changed and the simulation re-run, then you 
can step forwards and backwards in generations, or play the whole set as an
animation.

The program output looks like:

Enjoy!
